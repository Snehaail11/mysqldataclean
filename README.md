# Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates how I clean real-world datasets to prepare them for analysis. I addressed issues like missing values, duplicate rows, inconsistent formats, and outliers to make the data reliable and ready for further use.

## What I Did

- Handled missing data by imputing or removing, based on the context.
- Removed duplicate records to ensure data quality.
- Standardized formats such as dates and text fields for consistency.
- Detected and treated outliers using statistical methods and visualization.
- Documented the cleaning steps for clarity and reproducibility.

## Why This Project Matters

Data cleaning is a crucial first step in any data science workflow. This project highlights my attention to detail and my approach to building a strong foundation for analysis and modeling.

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis
